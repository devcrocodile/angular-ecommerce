# Package.json

Husky is a really cool npm package that lets you define npm scripts that correlate to local Git events such as a commit or push.
Husky is a very popular (1 million downloads a month) npm package that allows custom scripts to be ran against your repository. Husky works with any project that uses a package.json file.

This really reduces the friction of using this feature of Git. So for example, if you install Husky using the command

npm install husky --save-dev


"husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "npm run lint",
      "pre-push": "npm run lint"
    }
}
Any time you try and commit, the hooks will run your lint command first. The hooks will not allow your commit to pass if the lint are failing.

ðŸ˜œ Donâ€™t worry, you can force a commit with --no-verify if you find yourself in the situation where you just want to commit even though your pre-commit hooks donâ€™t succeed.

git commit -m "first commit" --no-verify


I have added the following entries to the package.json

"precommit": "ng lint && npm test",
"prepush": "ng lint && ng build --aot true && npm test"
This sets up means that on a commit we:

lint the code
then run tests
and before pushing to a remote repository we:

perform an optimized build
then run unit tests
